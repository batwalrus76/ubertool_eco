Specific mechanistic hypotheses, tests in summary, populations to which the hypotheses are to be applied 

Methods 

A. List of variables and sources of variation, sorted byindepen- dent and dependent variables, with reasons for their selection 

B. Other sources of variation and how they will be dealt with 

C. Study design and analysis, including models, statistical tests if used, detailed analytical procedures, graphs of potential outcomes 

D. Field, laboratory, and computational procedures, in sufficient detail so that someone other than the author could do the study 

VII. Budget and Schedule 

A. A comprehensive three-column budget for the duration of the study 

B. A schedule of tasks with initiation and completion target dates, with designated responsibilities and reporting requirements and dates

III. Reports and Publications
