The Spatial Aquatic Model (SAM) is a spatial implementation designed to 
compare modeled aquatic concentrations of pesticides to
toxicity thresholds. Pesticide exposure concentrations are estimated as a 
function of environmental factors and management practices. The outputs are a
time series of pesticide concentrations at multiple point locations. The ratios
of exposure concentrations to toxicity thresholds can then be characterized in 
terms of magnitude, duration, frequency and specific locations of exceedance for 
pesticide effects determinations.

SAM more realistically incorporates the spatial heterogeneity within assessed 
drainage areas (soils, land cover, weather data) 
instead of assuming a single uniform watershed designed to reflect high-end/protective 
exposures than previous pesticide registration models. 
Exposures are generated for headwater streams and small water bodies but 
are also be  integrated downstream for larger streams and water bodies. 
In addition, exposure concentrations are not restricted to 
standardized field/basin/water bodies (e.g., farm pond and index reservoir), but 
reflect variability within and 
across use areas. Output concentrations are then be aggregated at the 
outlet portion of the drainage area (drinking water basin or HUC12 unit). 
For ecological assessments, exposure estimates are based on the 
main channel within the HUC12. Aquatic exposure areas are binned as static 
or flowing water bodies.

<p>
Due to the national scale of this tool, instead of routing flow from fields 
within basins to stream channels to larger streams, flow is accumulated at the HUC12 
unit level, routing outputs from headwater basins at the top of a 
larger drainage shed through downstream HUCs.
Daily estimates can be compared to stream gage data for flow and to monitoring 
data for pesticide outputs.

This is a beta version, important routines including erosion, spray drift,
irrigation, travel times beyond “dayshed”, and the application window 
(function of weather, crop stage) are in development.

A lot of input information and some algorithmic output is pre-processed to 
make exposure concentration estimation on this scale possible in a 
reasonable amount of time. Spatially, soils are group into combinatoric 
classes based on important pesticide transport factors, weather files have been 
interpolated to an appropriate spatial resolution (~24,000 km grids), land 
cover captures temporal variability of the prior 4-5 years of the Cropscape
Data Layer, crop inputs include a full range of crops from an incorporated
data base, and the hydrology is currently based on monthly flow data
and defining single-day travel times for processing downstream pesticide loads.

 (replacing the downstream dilution model). 

Soils – Soil Survey Geographic database (SSURGO) most detailed soil dataset
Routines developed to extract data from SSURGO’s complex data structure and convert to model inputs
Land Use / Land Cover – Cropland Data Layer provides a footprint of crop/use distribution
Using crop groupings to reduce errors in identification
Need to address multi-year rotations
Weather - Precipitation, temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, pan evap
extracting weather data for 1948-2012 using NCEP/NCAR [Natl Ctrs for Envir. Prediction/Atmos. Research) reanalysis data

In national scale-up, we are considering the use of NOAA Climate Prediction Center’s fine scale precipitation data…the NCAR/NCEP dataset (or another dataset) would still need to be used for other variables (Temp, Pan Evap)

Crop growth/management - 
Begin w/ PRZM manual, add spatial variations as we can find them
USDA typical planting and harvesting dates publications; other state/regional publications
USDA Plant Hardiness Zone map to reflect spatial variations

Recipe files = list of model units in basin & total area of each unit
NHD Plus Annual Avg Total Flow

SuperScenarioGenerator – outputs runoff for sub watershed (calculated using CN Method)
SuperPRZMhydro – sums up runoff (from all crops) to represent entire watershed; outputs Total Daily Runoff & Total Area
SuperPRZMpesticide – outputs Pesticide Concentration in Water body (based on Total Daily Runoff + Base flow, and Pesticide Mass)

Backbone/Foundation of SAM comes from PRZM/EXAMS – many of the same processes and assumptions
In terms of hydrology it is pretty much all accounted for in the same way; this includes precip, snowmelt, …
    - CN methodology the same (NRCS) – where CN used to estimate direct runoff (& infiltration) from rainfall event

1-D solute transport in SAM is derived from PRZM/EXAMS
