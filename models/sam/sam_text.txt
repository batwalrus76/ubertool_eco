The Spatial Aquatic Model (SAM) is a spatial implementation designed to 
compare modeled aquatic concentrations of pesticides to
toxicity thresholds. Pesticide exposure concentrations are estimated as a 
function of environmental factors and management practices. The outputs are a
time series of pesticide concentrations at multiple point locations. The ratios
of exposure concentrations to toxicity thresholds can then be characterized in 
terms of magnitude, duration, frequency and specific locations of exceedance for 
pesticide effects determinations.

SAM more realistically incorporates the spatial heterogeneity within assessed 
drainage areas (soils, land cover, weather data) 
instead of assuming a single uniform watershed designed to reflect high-end/protective 
exposures than previous pesticide registration models. 
Exposures are generated for headwater streams and small water bodies but 
are also be  integrated downstream for larger streams and water bodies. 
In addition, exposure concentrations are not restricted to 
standardized field/basin/water bodies (e.g., farm pond and index reservoir), but 
reflect variability within and 
across use areas. Output concentrations are then be aggregated at the 
outlet portion of the drainage area (drinking water basin or HUC12 unit). 
For ecological assessments, exposure estimates are based on the 
main channel within the HUC12. Aquatic exposure areas are binned as static 
or flowing water bodies.

Due to the national scale of this tool, instead of routing flow from fields 
within basins to stream channels to larger streams, flow is accumulated at the HUC12 
unit level, routing outputs from headwater basins at the top of a 
larger drainage shed through downstream HUCs.
Daily estimates can be compared to stream gage data for flow and to monitoring 
data for pesticide outputs.

This is a beta version, important routines including erosion, spray drift,
irrigation, travel times beyond “dayshed”, and the application window 
(function of weather, crop stage) are in development.

Figure 1 shows the data flow and algorithmic estimation procedure of SAM.

A lot of input information and some algorithmic output is pre-processed to 
make exposure concentration estimation on this scale possible in a 
reasonable amount of time. Spatially, soils are group into combinatoric 
classes based on important pesticide transport factors, weather files have been 
interpolated to an appropriate spatial resolution (~24,000 km grids), land 
cover captures temporal variability of the prior 4-5 years of the Cropscape
Data Layer, crop inputs include a full range of crops from an incorporated
data base, and the hydrology is currently based on NHD Plus monthly flow data
and defining single-day travel times for processing downstream pesticide loads.

Recipe files are used to create a list of model units in basin and total area 
of each unit to be simulated. The one-dimensional solute transport in SAM 
is derived from PRZM/EXAMS, there are
many of the same processes and assumptions. The approach 
consists of: SuperScenarioGenerator, which outputs runoff for sub watersheds
using the curve number method (used to estimate direct runoff and infiltration 
from rainfall events); SuperPRZMhydro, which sums up runoff (from all crops) 
to represent the entire watershed and outputs total daily runoff and total area; 
and SuperPRZMpesticide, which outputs the pesticide concentrations in the water 
body based on total daily runoff, base flow, and pesticide mass.
